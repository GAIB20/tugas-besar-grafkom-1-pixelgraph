## General Information

WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. WebGL does so by introducing an API that closely conforms to OpenGL ES 2.0 that can be used in HTML5 `<canvas>` elements. This conformance to OpenGL ES 2.0 allows for the porting of applications that make use of the API to the web platform. WebGL is widely supported in modern browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge. The API is also supported on mobile devices, including those running Android and iOS.
